                        player is assigned the black pieces. Friends may watch and chat with both players as they play.

                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                    <p>White moves first, with players alternating turns. Each turn consists
                        of two mandatory phases:</p>
                    <p>1) <em>Add</em>: add a new piece of your color to an empty square on the board. This is the
                        active piece for the turn.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-right"><img src="/images/how-to-play/drop.jpg"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-subsection">
                <div class="text-portion">
                    <p>2) <em>Force</em>: The active piece then exerts a force that attracts pieces of the same color
                        and repels pieces of the other color. Any same-color piece that is visible to the active
                        piece will move along its row or column and end up next to the active piece. Any opposite-color piece that
                        is visible to the active piece will move away from the active piece along its row or
                        column until blocked by another piece or the edge of the board. Every piece that is in the same row or
                        column as the active piece and has no pieces between it and the active piece must be moved. A piece may
                        still be played even if it does not attract or repel any other pieces.</p>

                    <h3>Prohibited Moves</h3>
                    <p>Any move which would cause exactly three pieces of the same color to be next to each other in a
                        row or column at the end of the turn is prohibited. The only exception is that three peices of the same
                        color can be adjacent to each other along the edge of the board.</p><br>

                    <h3>Winning</h3>
                    <p>A player wins if four or mroe of their pieces are next to each other in a row or column at the
                        end of any turn. These pieces cannot all be along the edge of the board. A player can win after their turn
                        or after an opponent's turn. If a turn ends with both players getting four or more in a row, the player
                        who did not make the move wins. A move that creates a prohibited three-in-a-row of the either color is
                        not allowed, even if doing so would also create a four-in-a-row for one of the players.</p>

                    <h3>Endgame</h3>
                    <p>The primary goal of Fource is to achieve a four-in-a-row victory as described above, but it is
                        possible that no player attains that condition. There are two other ways that a game can come to an end.
                        First, all pieces could be playd with no player getting four of their pieces in a row. Second, one
                        player could run out of legal moves to make even though they still have pieces to play.</p>
                    <p>If one player has no more legal moves, the other player may take one additional turn if they are
                        willing and able to do so. If the extra turn does not result in a four-in-a-row victory, the game ends,
                        even if the first player can now make a legal move. Once no more pieces are to be played, players remove
                        all of their pieces from the board that are not in orthogonally-connected groups of at least four
                        pieces. Whoever ahs the most pieces left on the baord wins. If there is a tie, whoever has the largest
                        otherogonally-connected group wins. If there is still a tie, the result is a tie. If players
                        decide to play multiple games in a row, switch colors between each game.</p>
